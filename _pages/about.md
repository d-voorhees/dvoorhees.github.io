# About

Dev Logs with D. Voorhees is a space where I share thoughts and resources on software development topics. It will also serve as a platform for open-source coding projects.

I am a growth-oriented software engineer, technical consultant, solutions architect, advisor, and communications professional. Over the past 11 years, I have primarily worked with companies on sales and growth strategies through their websites while also handling extensive integration work with other software and internal computer systems. Before transitioning into consulting, I managed a large website for a major bank, trained as an economist, taught economics and data analysis for business at the college level, and worked as a journalist.

On the programming side, I work with PHP, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Ruby, while occasionally exploring other languages as needed for projects. In Growth & Analytics, I utilize Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager, Google Search Console, Google Merchant Center, Google Ads, Mixpanel, Amplitude, and A/B testing. When it comes to APIs & Integrations, I specialize in RESTful APIs, Zapier, Make, and HubSpot. For data visualization, I use Looker, Google Data Studio, and other tools.

I also have expertise in performance optimization & UX, including web performance tuning, conversion rate optimization (CRO), and user journey analysis. I am passionate about SEO, SEM and content strategy, covering everything from technical SEO and on-page optimization to content marketing and persuasive copywriting. Over the past few years, I have been sharpening my skills in AI/ML tools and continue to expand my knowledge in this field.
